 Goal is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their xyz and seasonal flu vaccines. Specifically, I will be predicting two probabilities: one for xyz_vaccine and one for seasonal_vaccine.
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of respondents taking the xyz and seasonal vaccines. I followed these steps: 1) Loaded and cleaned the datasets, removing rows with missing target values. 2) Separated target variables from features and dropped unnecessary columns. 3) Handled missing values using SimpleImputer. 4) Encoded categorical variables with OneHotEncoder and standardized numerical features with StandardScaler. 5) Combined the processed features into a single dataset. 6) Trained logistic regression models for both vaccines and evaluated their performance using AUC-ROC scores. 7) Generated predictions for the test set and saved the results to a CSV file for submission. This method ensured our model was well-prepared and provided accurate predictions.
